## III.3.7 bge.un.\<length\> &ndash; branch on greater than or equal to, unsigned or unordered

 | Format | Assembly Format | Description
 | ---- | ---- | ----
 | 41 _\<int32\>_ | `bge.un` _target_ | Branch to _target_ if greater than or equal to (unsigned or unordered).
 | 34 _\<int8\>_ | `bge.un.s` _target_ | Branch to _target_ if greater than or equal to (unsigned or unordered), short form.

#### Stack Transition:

&hellip;, _value1_, _value2_ &rarr; &hellip;

#### Description:

The `bge.un` instruction transfers control to _target_ if _value1_ is greater than or equal to _value2_, when compared unsigned (for integer values) or unordered (for floating-point values).

_target_ is represented as a signed offset (4 bytes for `bge.un`, 1 byte for `bge.un.s`) from the beginning of the instruction following the current instruction.

The acceptable operand types are encapsulated in [Table 4: Binary Comparison or Branch Operations](#todo-missing-hyperlink).

If the target instruction has one or more prefix codes, control can only be transferred to the first of these prefixes.

Control transfers into and out of **try**, **catch**, **filter**, and **finally** blocks cannot be performed by this instruction. (Such transfers are severely restricted and shall use the `leave` instruction instead; see [Partition I](i.12.4.2-exception-handling.md) for details).

#### Exceptions: None.

#### Correctness:

Correct CIL shall observe all of the control transfer rules specified above and shall guarantee that the top two items on the stack correspond to the types shown in [Table 4: Binary Comparison or Branch Operations](#todo-missing-hyperlink).

#### Verifiability:

Verifiable code requires the type-consistency of the stack, locals and arguments for every possible path to the destination instruction. See ยง[III.1.8](iii.1.8-verifiability-and-correctness.md) for more details.
