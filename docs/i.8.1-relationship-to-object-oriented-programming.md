## I.8.1 Relationship to object-oriented programming

> _This subclause contains only informative text._

The term **type** is often used in the world of value-oriented programming to mean data representation. In the object-oriented world it usually refers to behavior rather than to representation. In the CTS, type is used to mean both of these things: two entities have compatible types if and only if they have compatible representations and compatible behaviors. Thus, in the CTS, if one type is derived from a base type, then instances of the derived type can be substituted for instances of the base type because both the representation and the behavior are compatible.

Unlike in some OOP languages, in the CTS, two objects that have fundamentally different representations have different types. Some OOP languages use a different notion of type. They consider two objects to have the same type if they respond in the same way to the same set of messages. This notion is captured in the CTS by saying that the objects implement the same interface.

Similarly, some OOP languages (e.g., Smalltalk) consider message passing to be the fundamental model of computation. In the CTS, this corresponds to calling virtual methods (see ยง[I.8.4.4](i.8.4.4-virtual-methods.md)), where the signature of the virtual method plays the role of the message.

The CTS itself does not directly capture the notion of "typeless programming." That is, there is no way to call a non-static method without knowing the type of the object. Nevertheless, typeless programming can be implemented based on the facilities provided by the reflection package (see [Partition IV - Reflection](iv.5.5-reflection-library.md)) if it is implemented.
