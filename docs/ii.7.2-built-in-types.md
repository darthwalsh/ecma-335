## II.7.2 Built-in types

The CLI built-in types have corresponding value types defined in the Base Class Library. They shall be referenced in signatures only using their special encodings (i.e., not using the general purpose **valuetype** _TypeReference_ syntax). [Partition I](i.8.2.1.1-managed-pointers-and-related-types.md) specifies the built-in types.
