Nested types shall have no visibility, but instead shall have exactly one of the accessibility attributes **nested assembly**, **nested famandassem**, **nested family**, **nested famorassem**, **nested private**, or **nested public**. The default visibility for top-level types is **private**. The default accessibility for nested types is **nested private**.
