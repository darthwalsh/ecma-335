## III.1.8.1 Flow control restrictions for verifiable CIL

This subclause specifies a verification algorithm that, combined with information on individual CIL instructions (see ยง[III.3](iii.3-base-instructions.md)) and metadata validation (see [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink)), guarantees memory integrity.

The algorithm specified here creates a minimum level for all compliant implementations of the CLI in the sense that any program that is considered verifiable by this algorithm shall be considered verifiable and run correctly on all compliant implementations of the CLI.

The CLI provides a security permission (see [Partition IV](#todo-missing-hyperlink)) that controls whether or not the CLI shall run programs that might violate memory safety. Any program that is verifiable according to this standard does not violate memory safety, and a conforming implementation of the CLI shall run such programs. The implementation might also run other programs provided it is able to show they do not violate memory safety (typically because they use a verification algorithm that makes use of specific knowledge about the implementation).

_[Note:_ While a compliant implementation is required to accept and run any program this verification algorithm states is verifiable, there might be programs that are accepted as verifiable by a given implementation but which this verification algorithm will fail to consider verifiable. Such programs will run in the given implementation but need not be considered verifiable by other implementations.
 
Implementers of the CLI are urged to provide a means for testing whether programs generated on their implementation meet this portable verifiability standard. They are also urged to specify where their verification algorithms are more permissive than this standard. _end note]_

Only valid programs shall be verifiable. For ease of explanation, the verification algorithm described here assumes that the program is valid and does not explicitly call for tests of all validity conditions. Validity conditions are specified on a per-CIL instruction basis (see ยง[III.3](iii.3-base-instructions.md)), and on the overall file format in [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink).
