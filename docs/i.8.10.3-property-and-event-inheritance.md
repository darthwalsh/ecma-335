## I.8.10.3 Property and event inheritance

Fundamentally, properties and events are constructs of the metadata intended for use by tools that target the CLI and are not directly supported by the VES itself. Therefore, it is the job of the source language compiler and the reflection library (see [Partition IV â€“ Kernel Package](iv.3.1-the-kernel-profile.md)) to determine rules for name hiding, inheritance, and so forth. The source compiler shall generate CIL that directly accesses the methods named by the events and properties, not the events or properties themselves.
