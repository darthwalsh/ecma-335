## I.8.9.6.4 Supporting interface contracts

Object type definitions can declare that they support zero or more interface contracts. Declaring support for an interface contract places a requirement on the implementation of the object type to fully implement that interface contract. Implementing an interface contract always reduces to implementing the required set of methods, i.e., the methods required by the interface type.

The different types that the object type implements (i.e., the object type and any implemented interface types), are each a separate logical grouping of named members. If a class `Foo` implements an interface `IFoo`, and `IFoo` declares a member method int a(), and `Foo` also declares a member method `int a()`, there are two members, one in the `IFoo` interface type and one in the `Foo` class type. An implementation of `Foo` will provide an implementation for both, potentially shared. Similarly, if a class implements two interfaces `IFoo` and `IBar`, each of which defines a method `int a()`, the class will supply two method implementations, one for each interface, although they can share the actual code of the implementation.

> #### CLS Rule 20:
>
> CLS-compliant classes, value types, and interfaces shall not require the implementation of non-CLS-compliant members.
>
> _[Note:_
>
> **CLS (consumer):** Need not accept classes, value types or interfaces that violate this rule.
>
> **CLS (extender):** Need not provide syntax to author classes, value types, or interfaces that violate this rule.
>
> **CLS (framework):** Shall not externally expose classes, value types, or interfaces that violate this rule. If a CLS-compliant framework exposes a class implementing a non-CLS-compliant interface, the framework shall provide concrete implementations of all non-CLS-compliant members. This ensures that CLS extenders do not need syntax for implementing non-CLS-compliant members. _end note]_
