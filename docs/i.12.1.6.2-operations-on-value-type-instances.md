## I.12.1.6.2 Operations on value type instances

Value type instances can be [created](i.12.1.6.2.1-initializing-instances-of-value-types.md), [passed](i.12.1.6.2.3-passing-and-returning-value-types.md) as arguments, [returned](i.12.1.6.2.3-passing-and-returning-value-types.md) as values, and stored into and extracted from locals, fields, and elements of arrays (i.e., [copied](i.12.1.6.2.2-loading-and-storing-instances-of-value-types.md)). Like classes, value types can have both static and non-static members (methods and fields). But, because they carry no type information at runtime, value type instances are not substitutable for items of type `System.Object`; in this respect, they act like the built-in types `int32`, `int64`, and so forth. There are two operations, [`box`](i.12.1.6.2.5-boxing-and-unboxing.md) and [`unbox`](i.12.1.6.2.5-boxing-and-unboxing.md), that convert between value type instances and objects.
