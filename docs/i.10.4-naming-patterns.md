## I.10.4 Naming patterns

See also [Partition VI](vi.d-class-library-design-guidelines.md).

While the CTS does not dictate the naming of properties or events, the CLS does specify a pattern to be observed.

For Events:

An individual event is created by choosing or defining a delegate type that is used to indicate the event. Then, three methods are created with names based on the name of the event and with a fixed signature. For the examples below we define an event named `Click` that uses a delegate type named `EventHandler`.

 ```
 EventAdd, used to add a handler for an event
         Pattern: void add_<EventName> (<DelegateType> handler)
         Example: void add_Click (EventHandler handler);
 
 EventRemove, used to remove a handler for an event
         Pattern: void remove_<EventName> (<DelegateType> handler)
         Example: void remove_Click (EventHandler handler); 
 
 EventRaise, used to indicate that an event has occurred
         Pattern: void family raise_<EventName> (Event e)
 ```

For Properties:

An individual property is created by deciding on the type returned by its getter method and the types of the getterâ€™s parameters (if any). Then, two methods are created with names based on the name of the property and these types. For the examples below we define two properties: `Name` takes no parameters and returns a `System.String`, while `Item` takes a `System.Object` parameter and returns a `System.Object`. `Item` is referred to as an indexed property, meaning that it takes parameters and thus can appear to the user as through it were an array with indices.

 ```
 PropertyGet, used to read the value of the property
         Pattern: <PropType> get_<PropName> (<Indices>)
         Example: System.String get_Name ();
         Example: System.Object get_Item (System.Object key); 
 
 PropertySet, used to modify the value of the property
         Pattern: void set_<PropName> (<Indices>, <PropType>)
         Example: void set_Name (System.String name);
         Example: void set_Item (System.Object key, System.Object value);
 ```
