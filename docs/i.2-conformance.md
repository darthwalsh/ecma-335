## I.2 Conformance

A system claiming conformance to this International Standard shall implement all the normative requirements of this standard, and shall specify the profile (see [Partition IV Library &ndash; Profiles](iv.2.2-profiles.md)) that it implements. The minimal implementation is the Kernel Profile. A conforming implementation can also include additional functionality provided that functionality does not prevent running code written to rely solely on the profile as specified in this standard. For example, a conforming implementation can provide additional classes, new methods on existing classes, or a new interface on a standardized class, but it shall not add methods or properties to interfaces specified in this standard.

A compiler that generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL, see [Partition III](#todo-missing-hyperlink)) and claims conformance to this International Standard shall produce output files in the format specified in this standard, and the CIL it generates shall be correct CIL as specified in this standard. Such a compiler can also claim that it generates *verifiable* code, in which case, the CIL it generates shall be verifiable as specified in this standard.
