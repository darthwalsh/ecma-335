## I.8.5.1 Valid names

All name comparisons are done on a byte-by-byte (i.e., case sensitive, locale-independent, also known as code-point comparison) basis. Where names are used to access built-in VES-supplied functionality (e.g., the class initialization method) there is always an accompanying indication on the definition so as not to build in any set of reserved names.

> #### CLS Rule 4:
>
> Assemblies shall follow Annex 7 of Technical Report 15 of the Unicode Standard 3.0 governing the set of characters permitted to start and be included in identifiers, available online at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/tr15-18.html. Identifiers shall be in the canonical format defined by Unicode Normalization Form C. For CLS purposes, two identifiers are the same if their lowercase mappings (as specified by the Unicode locale-insensitive, one-to-one lowercase mappings) are the same. That is, for two identifiers to be considered different under the CLS they shall differ in more than simply their case. However, in order to override an inherited definition the CLI requires the precise encoding of the original declaration be used.
> _[Note:_
>
> **CLS (consumer):** Need not consume types that violate CLS Rule 4, but shall have a mechanism to allow access to named items that use one of its own keywords as the name.
>
> **CLS (extender):** Need not create types that violate CLS Rule 4. Shall provide a mechanism for defining new names that obey these rules, but are the same as a keyword in the language.
>
> **CLS (framework):** Shall not export types that violate CLS Rule 4. Should avoid the use of names that are commonly used as keywords in programming languages (see [Partition VI - Annex D](#todo-missing-hyperlink)) _end note]_
