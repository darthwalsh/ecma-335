## III.1.1.5 Runtime pointer types

There are two kinds of pointers: unmanaged pointers and managed pointers. For pointers into the same array or object (see [Partition I](i.8.9.2-unmanaged-pointer-types.md)), the following arithmetic operations are defined:

 * Adding an integer to a pointer, where the integer is interpreted as a number of bytes, results in a pointer of the same kind.

 * Subtracting an integer (number of bytes) from a pointer results in a pointer of the same kind. (Note that subtracting a pointer from an integer is not permitted.)

 * Two pointers, regardless of kind, can be subtracted one from the other, producing a signed integer that specifies the number of bytes between the addresses they reference.

None of these operations is allowed in verifiable code.

It is important to understand the impact on the garbage collector of using arithmetic on the different kinds of pointers. Since unmanaged pointers shall never reference memory that is controlled by the garbage collector, performing arithmetic on them can endanger the memory safety of the system (hence it is not verifiable), but since they are not reported to the garbage collector there is no impact on its operation.

Managed pointers, however, are reported to the garbage collector. As part of garbage collection both the contents of the location to which they point *and* the pointer itself can be modified. The garbage collector will ignore managed pointers if they point into memory that is not under its control (the evaluation stack, the call stack, static memory, or memory under the control of another allocator). If, however, a managed pointer refers to memory controlled by the garbage collector it *shall* point to either a field of an object, an element of an array, or the address of the element just past the end of an array. If address arithmetic is used to create a managed pointer that refers to any other location (an object header or a gap in the allocated memory) the garbage collectorâ€™s behavior is unspecified.
