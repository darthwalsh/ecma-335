## III.1.7.1 The instruction stream

The implementation of a method is provided by a contiguous block of CIL instructions, encoded as specified below. The address of the instruction block for a method as well as its length is specified in the file format (see [Partition II](ii.25-file-format-extensions-to-pe.md), CIL Physical Layout). The first instruction is at the first byte (lowest address) of the instruction block.

Instructions are variable in size. The size of each instruction can be determined (decoded) from the content of the instruction bytes themselves. The size of and ordering of the bytes within an instruction is specified by each instruction definition. Instructions follow each other without padding in a stream of bytes that is both alignment and byte-order insensitive.

Each instruction occupies an exact number of bytes, and until the end of the instruction block, the next instruction begins immediately at the next byte. It is invalid for the instruction block (as specified by the blockâ€™s length) to end without forming a complete last instruction.

Instruction prefixes extend the length of an instruction without introducing a new instruction; an instruction having one or more prefixes introduces only one instruction that begins at the first byte of the first instruction prefix.

_[Note:_ Until the end of the instruction block, the instruction following any control transfer instruction is decoded as an instruction and thus participates in locating subsequent instructions even if it is not the target of a branch. Only instructions can appear in the instruction stream, even if unreachable. There are no address-relative data addressing modes and raw data cannot be directly embedded within the instruction stream. Certain instructions allow embedding of immediate data as part of the instruction; however that differs from allowing raw data embedded directly in the instruction stream. Unreachable code can appear as the result of machinegenerated code and is allowed, but it shall always be in the form of properly formed instruction sequences.

The instruction stream can be translated and the associated instruction block discarded prior to execution of the translation. Thus, even instructions that capture and manipulate code addresses, such as call, ret, etc. can be virtualized to operate on translated addresses instead of addresses in the CIL instruction stream. _end note]_
