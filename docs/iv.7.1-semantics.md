## IV.7.1 Semantics

The XML specification conforms to the Document Type Definition (DTD) in [Figure 0-4](#todo-missing-hyperlink). Only types that are included in a specified library are included in the XML.

There are three types of elements/attributes:

 * Normative: An element or attribute is normative such that the XML specification would be incomplete without it.

 * Informative: An element or attribute is informative if it specifies information that helps clarify the XML specification, but without it the specification still stands alone.

 * Rendering/Formatting: An element or attribute is for rendering or formatting if it specifies information to help an XML rendering tool.

 Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the text associated with an element or an attribute (e.g., `#PCDATA`, `#CDATA`) is normative or informative depending on the element or attribute with which it is associated, as described in the figure.

 _[Note:_ Many of the elements and attributes in the DTD are for rendering purposes. _end note]_

#### Figure 0-4: XML DTD

> ```xml
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
> <!ELEMENT AssemblyCulture (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the culture of the assembly that defines the current type. Currently this value is always "none". It is reserved for future use.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT AssemblyInfo (AssemblyName, ((AssemblyPublicKey, AssemblyVersion) | (AssemblyVersion, AssemblyPublicKey)), AssemblyCulture, Attributes)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies information about the assembly of a given type. This information corresponds to sections of the metadata of an assembly as described in Partition II, and includes information from the `AssemblyName`, `AssemblyPublicKey`, `AssemblyVersion`, `AssemblyCulture` and `Attributes` elements.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT AssemblyName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the name of the assembly to which a given type belongs. For example, all of the types in the BCL are members of the "mscorlib" assembly.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT AssemblyPublicKey (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the public key of the assembly. The public key is represented as a 128-bit value.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT AssemblyVersion (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the version of the assembly in the form 2.0.x.y, where x is a build number and y is a revision number.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Attribute (AttributeName, Excluded?, ExcludedTypeName?, ExcludedLibraryName?)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the text for a custom attribute on a type or a member of a type. This includes the attribute name and whether or not the attribute type itself is contained in another library. If the `Excluded` element is omitted, it is assumed to have a value of 0.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT AttributeName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the name of the custom attribute associated with a type or member of a type. Also contains the data needed to instantiate the attribute.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Attributes (Attribute*)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the list of the attributes on a given type or member of a type.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Base (BaseTypeName?, ExcludedBaseTypeName?, ExcludedLibraryName?)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the information related to the base type of the current type. Although the `ExcludedBaseTypeName` and `ExcludedLibraryName` elements are rarely found within this element, they are required when a type inherits from a type not found in the current library.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT BaseTypeName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the fully qualified name of the class from which a type inherits (i.e., the type's base class).
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Constraints (ParameterAttribute+, BaseTypeName?) >
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the constraints for a covariant or contravariant type parameter.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Docs ((summary?, altmember?, altcompliant?, typeparam*, param*, returns?, value?, exception*, threadsafe?, remarks?, example?, permission?) | (typeparam*, param*, summary?, altmember?, altcompliant?, returns?, value?, exception*, threadsafe?, remarks?, example?, permission?) | (summary?, altmember?, altcompliant?, typeparam*, param*, returns?, value?, remarks?, threadsafe?, exception*, example?, permission?) | (typeparam*, param*, summary?, altmember?, altcompliant?, returns?, value?, remarks?, threadsafe?, exception*, example?, permission?))>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the textual documentation of a given type or member of a type.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Excluded (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies, by a '0' or '1', whether a given member can be excluded from the current type in the absence of a given library. '0' specifies that it cannot be excluded.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT ExcludedBaseTypeName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the fully qualified name of the type that the current type must inherit from if a given library were present in an implementation. The library name is specified in the `ExcludedLibraryName` element. An example is the `System.Type` class that inherits from `System.Object`, but if the Reflection library is present, it must inherit from `System.Reflection.MemberInfo`.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT ExcludedLibrary (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the library that must be present in order for a given member of a type to be required to be implemented. For example, `System.Console.WriteLine(double)` need only be implemented if the ExtendedNumerics library is available.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT ExcludedLibraryName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) This element appears only in the description of custom attributes. It specifies the name of the library that defines the described attribute. For example, the member that is invoked when no member name is specified for `System.Text.StringBuilder` (in C#, this is the indexer) is called "`Chars`". The attribute needed for this is `System.Reflection.DefaultMemberAttribute`. This is found in the RuntimeInfrastructure library. This element is used with the `ExcludedTypeName` element.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT ExcludedTypeName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies the fully qualified name of the attribute that is needed for a member to succesfully specify the given attribute. This element is related to the `ExcludedLibraryName` element and is used for attributes.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Interface (InterfaceName, Excluded?)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies information about an interface that a type implements. This element contains subelements specifying the interface name and whether another library is needed for the interface to be required in the current library. If the `Excluded` element is omitted, it is assumed to have a value of 0.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT InterfaceName (#PCDATA)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Represents the fully-qualified interface name that a type implements.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Interfaces (Interface*)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies information on the interfaces, if any, a type implements. There is one `Interface` element for each interface implemented by the type.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Libraries (Types+)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) This is the root element. Specifies all of the information necessary for all of the class libraries of the standard. This includes all of the types and all children elements underneath.
> 
> ```xml
> <!ELEMENT Member (MemberSignature+, MemberType, Attributes?, ReturnValue, TypeParameters?, Parameters, MemberValue?, Docs, Excluded?, ExcludedLibrary*)>
> ```
> 
> (Normative) Specifies information about a member of a type. This information includes the signatures, type of the member, co/contra-variant type parameters, parameters, etc., all of which are elements in the XML specification. If the `Excluded` element is omitted, it is assumed to have a value of 0.
